  <button class="accordion">Courses</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    <b>Calculus I:</b> 
    <br>
    In this class I learned "to understand and apply the basic concepts found in a second semester calculus
    course, namely volumes and surface areas of revolution, integration techniques and applications, first
    order ordinary differential equations, sequences and series"
    <br>
    <br><b>Intro to Computer Programming:</b> In this class I learned "the fundamentals of computer programming in Java, 
    with emphasis on applications in science and engineering. You will also learn about the broader field of computer science
    and algorithmic thinking, the fundamental approach that computer scientists take to solving problems."</br>
    <br>
    <b>Coumputer Science II:</b> "Topics to be covered in COMP211-212 include an introduction to the fundamental ideas of programming in 
    imperative and functional languages; correctness and cost specifications; and proof techniques for verifying specifications."
    <br>Discrete Mathematics: "This course is an introduction to discrete mathematical processes. Topics will include proof techniques 
    (such as proof by induction, proof by contradiction, etc.), logic, set theory, counting, number theory and algebra, among others."</br>
    <br>
    <b>Algorithms and Complexity:</b> "The course will cover the design and analysis of efficient algorithms. Basic topics will include greedy
    algorithms, divide-and-conquer algorithms, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms. Some advanced topics in algorithms 
    may be selected from other areas of computer science."
    <br>
    <br><b>Working with SAS:</b> "The course introduces students to programming, data management, and analysis with SAS. Through a series of 
    hands-on lab exercises, students learn to work with a variety of data formats and use SAS's programming capabilities to effectively
    manage and analyze their data, with an emphasis on data exploration and visualization."</br>
    <br>
    <b>Vectors and Matrices:</b> "This is a course in the algebra of matrices and Euclidean spaces that emphasizes the concrete and geometric. 
    Topics to be developed include solving systems of linear equations; matrix addition, scalar multiplication, and multiplication; properties of invertible matrices; determinants; elements of the theory of abstract finite dimensional real vector spaces; dimension of vector spaces; and the rank of a matrix. These ideas are used to develop basic ideas of Euclidean geometry and to illustrate the behavior of linear systems. We conclude with a discussion of eigenvalues and the diagonalization of matrices."
