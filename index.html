<h1 style="text-align:center;">Project #100</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> Welcome! In an effort to learn and solidify my coding skills, I have a created a goal for this summer of creating 100 mini projects. </p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, I am embarking on this project to practice the coding skills I already have and to learn new skills. 
Further more, I believe this project will build my confidence in my coding ability and challenge me to stretch my creativity, which 
I belive is just as essential to coding.</p>

<h2>Project #1// A Little About Myself</h2>
<p>This introduction page serves as project #1 as I remind myself of basical html skills and familirize myself with github.
My name is Franchesca Pe√±a. I am 20 years old and live in New York. I am a rising junior studying computer science and English
with a concentration in Creative Writing, so in addition to coding I also enjoy reading and writing. I like to consider myself a runner
and one of my biggest accoplishments of the past year was completing a halfmarathon</p>

<p>Please feel free to check back on my progress. 
Best, Franchesca. </p>
