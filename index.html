<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> Welcome! This summer I have set the goal of creating 100 mini coding projects. The project was inspired by Jennifer Dewalt's project
which can be found <a href="https://jenniferdewalt.com">here</a></p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>I am embarking on this project to practice the coding skills I already have and to learn new skills. 
Further more, I believe this project will build my confidence in my coding ability and challenge me to stretch my creativity, which 
I belive is just as essential to coding.</p>

<p><br></br>Please feel free to check back on my progress. 
<br></br>
<<i>Best, Franchesca.</i></p>

<h2>Project #1 // A Little About Myself</h2>
<p>This introduction page serves as project #1 as I remind myself of basical html skills and familirize myself with github.
My name is Franchesca Pe√±a. I am 20 years old and live in New York. I am a rising junior studying computer science and English
with a concentration in creative writing, so in addition to coding I also enjoy reading and writing. I also enjoy running
and one of my biggest accoplishments of the past year was completing a half marathon</p>
