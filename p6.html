<h2 style="text-align:center;">Google Coding Challenge</h2>
<p>Below is a coding challenge I received from Google Career Bytes.</p>
<img src="google_challenge.png" alt="terminal icon" style="width:800px;height:350px;">

<h2 style="text-align:center;">My Approach</h2>
<p>Though seemingly simple, this challenge took me several weeks to figure out. I solved the challenge using Java. The program works
by running three tests. First it courses through the input string until it finds a word (test1). Then, in order to determine if 
test1 is a full word, it courses through the remaining string until it finds another word (test2) (if it finds another word, then test 1 is a full word).
What if, however, test2 is not really a full word but a word that is part of a bigger word? 
Example: The word "favor" is actually part of the word "favorite".
To account for this possible error, we run a third test, test3, which courses through the remaining part of the string after finding test2
and checks if it can find a full word. If test3 cannot find a full word, test2 adds one more letter to its test word and continues this process
until it finds a full word.</p>

<p>When writing this program I originally thought I could preform the different tests by using recursion. However, I eventually figured
out that that did not work. I then created three seperate test that rely on each other by boolean results. Test1 is true if test2 is true
which is true if test3 is true. Another problem I ran into was implenting base cases, which in this case was checking if the 
string each test recieved was empty or null. </p>

<p>For a visual of this, click <a href="https://github.com/franchescapena/franchescapena.github.io/blob/master/google_challenge.java">here</a>
to view the code. To see exactly how the tests work, uncomment the System.out.println lines.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">How To Use My Code</h2>
<p>First, download the java application by clicking <a href="franchescapena.github.io/google_challenge.class">here</a>. Next, open terminal. Travel to the location containing the application (typically /Downloads). 
Run the program using the command: 
java google_challenge [INPUT HERE] where the input is the sentence without spaces.</p>
